    <p>WeMesh Inc.(rebranded as Rave Media) is a company located in Canada's Silicon Valley, Waterloo. The company developed a social video playback app where users can watch videos with friends and chat about it in real time. <br>

    As a UI/UX Designer at WeMesh, My responsibilities include designing and creating mockups for new and current features. Other responsibilities included creating assets (mobile and VR assets using Illustrator and Autodesk Maya), maintaining and updating the company's website (HTML, CSS, JavaScript/jQuery), and creating social media ads (Illustrator and Photoshop).</p>

    <h2 class="work-subtitle">Getting Started</h2>
    <p>The first task for the designers at WeMesh was to understand and explore the app. We meticulously dissected the app, pressing every button and testing all possible cases such as creating a private, public, local, and friends lobby.
