    <p style="margin-bottom: 0px">In Fall 2018, I returned to Electronic Arts as an Associate Product Manager Co-op on the FIFA Mobile Live team for the launch of season 3. FIFA Mobile is a football simulation mobile game developed by EA Mobile and it refreshes every year with new content and game mechanics.

    <br><br>
    Since this was my second time with the same team, my responsibilities increased and I had the opportunities to take ownership of certain events. My main responsibilities included participating in the design process and implementation of new events and programs, documenting new features and events on Confluence, maintaining base content, and updating weekly events.</p>

    <h2 class="work-subtitle center">Rest of World Campaign Design</h2>
    <p>I designed and implemented the layout of the Rest of World campaign and redesigned some layouts of other existing campaigns to produce a more cohesive UI and design. Some issues with previous layouts included spacing, aesthetics, and UI. When redesigning the layouts, restrictions included keeping the connection of nodes and the number of nodes the same. Below are some images of the design and redesign process of the campaign layouts.
