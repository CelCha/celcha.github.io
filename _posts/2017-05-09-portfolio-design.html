    <p>Every co-op term, I usually redesign my personal website due to new design practices and mostly to apply new skills I have obtained or old skills that I have improved. This term, the focus of the portfolio design was of course, the portfolio content. I wanted more pictures and less words which I tried to convey in my old design, but unfortunately it was poorly executed.<br><br>

    My old personal website was a one-page website and used JQuery to swap content in and out. This time, I learned to use Jekyll to set up templates and make swapping content more efficient. Below are a couple of mockups of potential portfolio designs created with Sketch.<br><br></p>
