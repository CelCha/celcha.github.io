    <p style="margin-bottom: 0px">Muqo is a new and upcoming music and social networking app. The social app allows users to add music from their libraries to their social media post.

    <br><br>
    Muqo was a client that asked for a simple website to showcase their new app. The purpose of the website was for users to find more information on the app and find the download link when it becomes available.

    I designed the Muqo website to be a simple, one-pager site. The menu buttons takes users to the appropriate section. The colour scheme of Muqo was red and white, therefore the website was revolved around these two colours. </p>

    After I finished the website, my client asked for a logo redesign/touch-up. Requests include raising the left side of the "u" and reorienting the microphone. I simplified the "O" and retraced the microphone in vector format. The original logo can be seen on the left (top) and the new logo on the right (bottom).</p>

    <p>I was also asked to redesign the main feed of the application. The goal was to clean up the UI and optimize the space used in the main feed. In Muqo, the main feed consists of social media posts and each post contained a photo, lyrics, a caption, and an area to play the attached song.</p>
