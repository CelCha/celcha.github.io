    <p>Odin with Friends is a hackathon project that I participated in when I was a QA Engineering Co-op at Zynga Inc. It was a 3 day project. The concept of the game was based on the office dog, Odin. The team decided to based the game off of Flappy Bird. As a result, Odin with Friends became a multiplayer version of Flappy Bird with the addition of horizontal controls. Players can propel themselves forward or backgrounds in addition to jumping over obstacles.

    <br><br><p>My role in Odin with Friends was the visual appearance of the game and creating game assets such as sprites, backgrounds, obstacles, splashscreen, and more. The husky is Odin, as well as the app icon.</p>

    <p>The visual style of the game was decided to be a pixel style to reflect on the style of Flappy Bird and due to time constraints. This was my first attempt at pixel art. Below is the home screen to Odin with Friends and the background of the game.</p>

    <p>I used Photoshop to create all the assets as well as the homescreen and background. The gif animation of Odin was done with 3 frames in Photoshop. Odin was then edited to make a second player, a shibainu. Below are mockups of the game screens.</p>
