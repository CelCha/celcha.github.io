    <p style="margin-bottom: 0px">In Fall 2017, I worked at Electronic Arts as an Associate Product Manager Co-op on the FIFA Mobile Live team. FIFA Mobile is a football simulation mobile game developed by EA Mobile.

    <br><br>
    I joined the team during the development of FIFA Mobile Season 2. My responsibilities included participating in the design process and implementation of new events and programs, documenting new features and events on Confluence, maintaining base content, and updating weekly events.

    <br><br>
    I designed and implemented the layout of the Rest of the World campaign and redesigned some layouts of other existing campaigns to produce a more cohesive UI and design. Some issues with previous layouts included spacing, aesthetics, and UI. When redesigning the layouts, restrictions included keeping the connection of nodes and the number of nodes the same. Below are some images of the design and redesign process of the campaign layouts.
