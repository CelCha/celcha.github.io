    <p>Spotly is a web application that allows users to share and track their fitness progress. This project is currently in progress with 2 other developers. I hold the responsibility of designing the UI and visual appearance of the web-site as well as implementing the front-end. The front-end is currently being implemented with HTML, CSS/SASS, and JavaScript. Below are the initial mock-ups of the website.
    <br><br>The project can be found at <a style="color: #00d1b2;" href="https://github.com/jnkfong/Spotly">Spotly.</a></p>
